# Codsoft Virtual Internship Program Projects

Welcome to the repository for projects completed during the Codsoft Virtual Internship Program. This repository contains three projects:

1. Credit Card Fraud Detection Model
2. Titanic Survival Prediction Model
3. Iris Classification Model

Below is a brief overview of each project:

## 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection Model
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model aims to accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on various features associated with each transaction.

## 2. Titanic Survival Prediction Model
In this project, a machine learning model is built to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Using the Titanic dataset, the model predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and others.

## 3. Iris Classification Model
This project involves building a classification model to classify iris flowers based on their features. The model uses the popular Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm.

## Repository Structure
- Each project is organized into its own directory within the repository.
- Project-specific code, Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, and documentation are provided within each directory.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- Required libraries for each project are listed in their respective README files.
