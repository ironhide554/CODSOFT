# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting survival on the Titanic using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model is trained on the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and others.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers onboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset is available in the file `titanic.csv`.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- scikit-learn (>=0.24.0)
- pandas (>=1.1.5)
- numpy (>=1.19.5)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
    cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `titanic_survival.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions and run the cells to train the Random Forest Classifier model and evaluate its performance.
3. Optionally, you can also experiment with different algorithms or feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance.

## Model Evaluation
The Random Forest Classifier model achieved the following performance metrics:
- Accuracy: 81%
- Precision: 81%
- Recall: 64%
- F1 Score: 71%
