## Iris Classification Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model achieves perfect accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, indicating excellent performance.

## Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated on the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- scikit-learn (>=0.24.0)
- pandas (>=1.1.5)
- numpy (>=1.19.5)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ironhide554/Iris_Classification.git
    cd Iris_Classification
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Iris_classification.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions and run the cells to train the Random Forest Classifier model and evaluate its performance.
3. Optionally, you can experiment with different algorithms or feature engineering techniques to further improve the model's performance.
